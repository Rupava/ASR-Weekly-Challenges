# ASR-Weekly-Challenges

This repository is a collection of our team's weekly challenges over various problem statements.
Each programming language has project folders named with the project name and the week and year of the project.
Inside each project folder, there is a readme file with the problem statement for the challenge.
Feel free to use and modify the code however you want, but we are not liable for any damages that could be caused/ if caused by our challenges.
